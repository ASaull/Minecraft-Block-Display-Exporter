# Minecraft Block Display Exporter Blender Plugin


### TODO
 - Support block models for blocks without variants
 - Support cross-shaped plants
 - Fix origin command block resetting to command block
 - Support removing model entirely, with empty type
 - Create user-visible error messages for file-loading errors
 - Allow the user to only input their .minecraft directory, and just choose the latest version of Minecraft automatically
 - Deal with cases where texture is animated (only take top 16x16)
 - Account for texture uv rotation (anvil)
 - Give colour to grayscale blocks (leaves, stems)
 - Create a bed model since they are hardcoded into the game. (why??) So are conduits...
 - Support textures that determine UVs automatically (composter)
